# Quick Power System
 This repo contains a power system model which is developed as part of my PhD.

# How to run this model
1. Modify input files in the [user_inputs](user_inputs/) folder
2. [Optional - Advanced] Test different kinds of constraints in the [Builder class](src/core/builder.py/)
3. Run [main.py](src/main.py) under the [src](src/) folder
4. Check out the plots under outputs folder
